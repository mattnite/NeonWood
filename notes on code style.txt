I started with functions_like_this 

primarily because the vulkan book I was reading 
used that style for all of their code 

However now that i'm starting to move away form 
that book i find that this naming scheme feels weaker
I'll continue to employ it while im under vk_renderer 

but going forward into the future i'm going to be 

using funcLikeThis 

for member functions  

and values_like_this for text values 

Comptime values such as types are always capital


Also I think from now on I will prefer @This() to Self. 

Less error prone and it gets more value from linting.
